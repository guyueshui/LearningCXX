/*
 * Ex 12.3
 *  const object won't need modifiers! While const member
 *  functions are called by const object. So there is no
 *  need to write a const version of `push_back` and
 *  `pop_back`.
 *
 * Ex 12.4
 *  Since the type of `i` is vector<string>::size_type,
 *  which is unsigned, and the exception that "i<0" will
 *  be handled by std::vector.
 *
 * Ex 12.5
 *  Omitted, maybe later.
